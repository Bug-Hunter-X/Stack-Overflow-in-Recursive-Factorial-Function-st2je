This repository contains a simple Haskell program demonstrating a common error in recursive functions: a missing base case leading to stack overflow. The `factorialBug.hs` file shows the erroneous code, while `factorialSolution.hs` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the infinite recursion when the function doesn't terminate. The solution adds a proper base case to handle the factorial of 0.
